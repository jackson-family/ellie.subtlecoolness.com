title: Chapter 8
category: My First Book

I wake up to: *“up here”!* Um... Carlos? What? You think that was me? No... it was my ol’
buddy Jake. He’s always had a reputation. *Man. All this “reputation” is going to have the cops on our tail.*
I thought. Hey Jay... I *miiiight* know why you are “famous”. I see a poster on
the wall. I read: *Jay Gonzolez: concert Saturday noon. Come now!* Don't *miss your chance!*
Well... *that* explains a lot. I say. Guys! Anyone got a podcast I can listen to? I've got a phone
and earbuds. I say. Juke Boss!? Bro, that's my favorite band! I shrug. Guys? We should get
home now. Ok. Bye! I sleep *very* soundly. I don't know how, I just do. The next morning, I
awoke to the sound of Jake spray-painting. Jake! I scold. Heeeeeeeey, you’re awake! *Sigh.* I
am now, man. Sorry bout’ that. I was just reminding myself of how fun it is to do graffiti. I
used to do it with my friends tricky and- *wait for it-* lucy! I laugh in response. Wow! This lucy
sounds a lot like me. I like doing art.” “Maybe not graffiti though.” “Ha! What kind of art?” “I like
drawing wolves and dogs.” “Ok lone wolf.” Lone wolf. I like that. Hmm.” “What?” I asked. “I like the
look of phoenixes and colorful birds but… I also like drawing wolves.” “Wow. We’re so alike.” Suddenly,
I get a text. It says: r u free to play??👏👏 I reply: no sry. Emmy. Sigh. We’re always texting each
other. “Well,” … Jake starts. “I gotta go. The “crew” is kind of waiting.” Ok bye! “Bye Lucy!”
