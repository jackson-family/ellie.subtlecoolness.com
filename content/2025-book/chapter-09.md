“Come on!”” Please?” *Sigh.* No. I won't do it. I won’t climb the gas station! Come on. *Pleeeeeeeeeeease?* No! When
will you understand? Ok, ok. But at least come scale roofs with me. *Fine, Jay.* But why exactly do I want to do this?
Because it's fun! Fine. *Sigh.* Ugh. I’m scaling the roof when... ahhhh! I trip and fall! Jay?! JAY!!! Lucy! *Crunch.*
Ow. Ow. Ow. Lucy, you need to rest. I hear. Oh. Hi Carlos. *Urgggh.* That *hurts.* Lucy? I think you kind of broke your
leg. *Oh. That’s why I need my rest.* I can't move, I say. See? You definitely broke your leg. Yeah. Thats why
I wouldn't climb the gas station, Jay! Um... s-sorry. Jay stammers. I didn’t know. Wait... I start. Where am I? You are
at our friend's house. She- *she?* I ask. Um... yeah. *She* was trained at a doctor before she ran away. She’ll know how
to help you. Oh good. Hold still. I hear. “This might hurt.” *oh great.* owchyyyyyyyyyy! Oh. My. Goodness. I have never
felt so much pain in my entire life. “Chill out.”” Your leg wasn’t broken.” I hear. “It was fractured.” However, it was
a bad fracture.” “Jay, what were you thinking when you took a *first timer* roof scaling?” *ha-ha.* I think. “ummmmmm”
Jay says. Hehe! I chuckle. “Iiiiiiiiiiii, um, was um, just teaching Lucy here how to um, do it?”
*“Jaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay!”* I hear. Heh. Jay. He could be a comedian.
