title: Chapter 1
category: My First Book

Back in my room again. What is wrong with me? I cannot believe I was sent up here again.
The view isn&#x02bc;t so bad though. Our giant willow tree reaching out and touching the
roof. Down the stairs, my mom and dad are arguing about &ldquo;adult stuff.&rdquo; I pop
in my earbuds and listen to my favorite artist: Taylor Swift. My room is quiet except
for _Lover_ blasting in my ears. Suddenly, I hear a knock on my door. ugh. It&#x02bc;s
my brother Luke. &ldquo;Lucy? Movie time!&rdquo; I smile. Tonight is the Disney marathon.
We watch _Frozen_, _Snow White_, and _Sleeping Beauty_. I immediately get sent straight
back up into my room for bed.
