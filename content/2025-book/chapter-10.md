title: Chapter 10
category: My First Book

*Woah.* Gray foxes are *cool.* “*Shhhh*. Be quiet.” I hear. The gray fox tilts its head. Then, it runs off.  “That was
amazing!” I say. “Hey its… almost sunset. Didn’t that Jay Gonzolez guy perform tonight?” Carlos asks. *Oh yeah. Him.*
“Um… do you think we should go and um, …see that? I’m curious about it.” I ask. “Uh *duh.* we *have to*. Jay said so.”
Jake says. *Sigh.* “Ok.”  *Woah.* That is *some music*. Jay looks down at the stage. His jaw hits the floor. “DAD!?!?”
We all stare at him. “Let’s go.” Jay says. I’m worried about him. He’s never acted that way before. I find him standing
alone on a roof. “…Jay?” I ask. “I’m *fine* Lucy.” “You don’t seem like it,” I say. “It’s just… Nobody has seen my dad
in *years*. He said he’d never perform again after what happened to him on his 10th performance.” “What happened?” I
ask.
