title: Chapter 11
category: My First Book

“On the night of his tenth performance,” Jay starts, “He got bullied. Some so called “friends” rigged the stage. He was
just about to sing his single, when the power went out. His friends came on the speaker and framed him for a crime he
didn’t commit.” *That’s terrible.* I thought. “He went to jail for a few years and got out on good behavior. He never
performed again… until tonight.” “I’m so sorry for you Jay,” I say. “Yeah, it’s nothing personal. Just don’t tell the
crew, ok?” “Got it,” I say. I can’t sleep the next few nights. I’m up till midnight pacing the alleyway. How could I not
tell the crew? How could the crew not know? How could I keep this secret? It’s impossible. It’s just impossible. Sigh.
One word. One. How? Then I remember how. I am a lone wolf who has run away from her pack. Joined another. Helped another
alpha wolf. I… am Lucy Jhonson.
