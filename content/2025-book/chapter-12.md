title: Chapter 12
category: My First Book

I couldn’t sleep that night either. I just couldn’t keep Jay’s secret. How could I not tell the crew? How could I not
tell my family? How? I just couldn't. I just… I don’t know how to tell them anymore. That’s why Jay relies on me to keep
his secrets. Because I don’t know how to tell them. Suddenly, I saw something glittering in the dirt. I bent over to
pick it up. *Opal!*  I thought. Then I remembered something. A few years ago, Jay had gifted me with a small opal
necklace. I searched eagerly for a thread. My heart leapt out of my chest. I saw it. A thin, black cord with a shard of
opal hanging from it. This gave me hope that Jay would recover.
