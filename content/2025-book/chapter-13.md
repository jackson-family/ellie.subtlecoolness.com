title: Chapter 13
category: My First Book

“Run Jay!” I scream. I feel my heart pounding in my chest. I can’t believe they caught up to us. The gang. Vicious,
brutal, and of course, *incredibly* weird. “What do you think I’m doing?!” Jay replies. “Well, I had to make sure!” I
call back. One of the Gang almost catches up to me! Then, I see Jake and Carlos coming from either side of me. They ram
into Macbeth, (That was his name. Macbeth.) nearly crushing him into another member of the Gang. Then, me and Jay see
something. Not just anything, an alleyway. We quickly run into it as Lucas, another member of the Gang, looks in.
luckily, Lucas didn’t have very good eyesight, so we were safe for now. *Gasp! OH NO!* I look over at Jay with
frightened eyes. “Where’s Jake and Carlos?”
