title: Chapter 2
category: My First Book

I wake up to my dog Zap licking my face. Zap! I scold. I put on my favorite Selena
Gomez shirt and cheetah print leggings. I go downstairs for breakfast. I have some jam
toast then go right back upstairs to snuggle with Zap. I do my finch and Duolingo.
Then, the doorbell rings. It’s my friend Emmy and her mom Amelia. Emmy! I shout. Ready
for the Minecraft marathon? “Yeah”! she says, together we shoot zombies, mine diamonds,
and tame wolves until her mom comes to pick her up. Bye Emmy! I say. A few hours later
I smell chili and cornbread. Yum. At dinner, dad just goes on and on about the new iPad
pro-16. After dinner and ice cream, I head back to my room for bed.
*Tomorrow will be better.* I think to myself.
