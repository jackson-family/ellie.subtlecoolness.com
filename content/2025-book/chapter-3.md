*Not again.* I think to myself as I rummage through my wardrobe. My hearts skirt is in the dirty pile.
I put on my Taylor Swift shirt and shorts and pop in my earbuds. “I got u”, Selena Gomez is playing.
I hum along and head downstairs for breakfast. *Finally.* I think to myself. *Pancakes.* I love pancakes.
The doorbell rings and I answer. April! I shout and give her a hug. I *totally* forgot that her family
was coming over today. April is my cousin. “Ready for some Mario cart”? She asks. Yeah! I answer. It’s
pretty close, but I come in first. Woo-hoo! I shout. Darn it. April says as she sets down her Wii remote.
Lucy! I hear my mom call. Time for cookies! *Yummy.* My mom’s chocolate chip cookies are the best cookies
ever. I happily eat two. Bye April! I say. See you later!
