title: Chapter 4
category: My First Book

*Owwww!* I think. *It burns!* I have been riding my bike for the past thirty minutes.
My legs are *burning*. I finally pull up to my driveway and pop the kickstand. I go
inside and collapse onto my couch. Ahh. That feels so good. I read my favorite book:
_A Forgery of Roses_. I open finch and put on a rain soundscape. I soon fall asleep.
I wake up to my window getting pounded by hail. Oh no! My dog Zap goes wild. I call
him and stroke his soft coat. Last night, I watched the movie _Elio_. I could relate.
My parents didn’t always understand me. That night, I lied in my bed staring at the
ceiling. Was my life really in this house? Really in this town? Did I really belong
here? The answer to that question… was no. my life was not in this house. Not in
this town. I didn’t belong here. Well, that settles it. I was running away tomorrow.
