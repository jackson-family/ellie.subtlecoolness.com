category: My First Book

*Sigh.* Was I really doing this? Yes. Yes, I was. I pack my phone, earbuds, my emergency
packed lunches, and much more. Today was the day. I couldn’t believe I was doing this. I
prepare a note to my mom and shove it under my bed. This was it. I eat breakfast with
thoughts clouding my mind. I do the last preparations for my “journey”.  At lunch, my dad
tells us about this new Zelda game. It’s called “Tears of the Kingdom”. It involves waking
up to some mysterious spirit called something like Raru? I honestly don’t know how to spell
it. Rarau maybe? Oh well… enough of that. At dinner I spend most of my time trying to undo
this knot in my hair. *Ow!* Ok… maybe “knot”. *Geddit?* That night, at twelve ’o’clock I
snuck out of the house. Thoughts were pounding my head. When I got out of the house, I ran
*2 miles* to the city. It was creepily quiet. I found a nice tree branch to sit on. I soon
lay down and fell asleep.
