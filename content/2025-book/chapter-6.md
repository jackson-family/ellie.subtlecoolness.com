title: Chapter 6
category: My First Book

*Yawn!* Wow. Good sleep. I awoke and immediately saw an alleyway with an old dog bed.
*Good enough for me.* I thought. I jumped off the tree and headed over, not making
eye contact with anyone. I sat down on the dog bed wondering what my parents were doing.
*Sigh.* I hope this is the right thing to do. I rummaged through the nearest trashcan.
I find an old coke can, a twinkie, and a… wait. A teddy bear? No… ACK! A raccoon! I
leap away quickly. I find a water bottle and splash some of it onto my hands. Lucy! I hear.
I freeze. I slowly turn around then… oh. *phew.* “Lucia”! Jay! My favorite runaway friend.
“I see you’ve been at it too”. Very funny, Jay. But… why are you here in Ninuic? Oh… I see.
You want a dog. “hahaha”! *You want a dog.* Ha! *No…* ha! I was *going* to visit you… ha-ha!
But I see I don’t have to look far.  You are hilarious, Lucy! Yeah. I noticed. “So… how’s it
been”?... good, I guess. “…how’s it *really* been”? … not great. I’m still skeptical about
running away from home.  I feel a tear forming in my eye. “I’ve got a “crew” now”. I look up.
Jay whistles. A second later I’m surrounded. “So…” one of them starts. “Is this that “friend
we’ve been told about”? y-you told them about me? Jay starts to blush. D-don’t mention it.
*Sigh.* Jay. Could never keep a secret. Well… Jay starts. He hands me a whistle. Just use it if you need us. Ok. See you!
