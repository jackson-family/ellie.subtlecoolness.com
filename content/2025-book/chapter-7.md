title: Chapter 7
category: My First Book

*Finally.* It takes forever to get Jay away from me. Anyway, it's getting dark. I should probably
invite Jay over to sleep. I blow on the whistle he gave me. Him and his “crew” come running.
Hey! I call. Do y'all want to sleep over here tonight? “sure”. One of the “crew” members
says. “Carlos”! Jay scolds. You can’t be serious.  Why would we want to? I’ve got some
stuffing and I’ve also been collecting trash cans.  All of them stare at me. *Oh gosh. This is embarrassing.*
Y-you don’t have to say yes. YEAH!! I stumble backward and chuckle. Ok ok.
Each of you, pick a trash can. Good night! Wait! Carlos calls. What? I ask. *Hey you! Uh-oh.*
This doesn’t look so good. It’s a police officer. I managed to duck behind the nearest trash
can, but Jay had no such luck. But then I hear something unexpected. Can I have your
autograph? *Huh?* We were all thinking the same thing. Jay Gonzoles. You are famous. All of
us are *so confused*. What? Jay asks. I said you are famous. Umm… bye! Have a good rest of
your night! The next thing I hear is WHAT!? Yeah! I say. what!?  Um… I *guess* I’m famous
now. Well… good night. Good night indeed.
